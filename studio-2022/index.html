            Traditionally the sun and the moon have masculine and feminine traits respectively.<br> 
            This was certainly true in Greek mythology. Selene was a Titan goddess, daughter of<br> 
            Hyperion and Theia, and sister to Helios (the sun god) and Eos (the goddess of the dawn).<br> 
            Selene (her Roman equivalent is Luna) drove a silver moon chariot across the sky each night.<br> 
            The moon is mysterious and understated, yet ominous and highly charged. Apply these qualities<br> 
            to a woman and the more uneasy among us will reply with words such as unreliable or mercurial,<br> 
            yet the moon has a firm path of growth and decline that never fails. In these phases can be <br>
            perceived the many complex characteristics that allude to the feminine.

            What about stars? The most talked-about star at this time of year is of course the Star of Bethlehem.<br> 
            While the jury doesn't seem to be out on this subject (rather there doesn't seem to be an obvious <br>
            science-based explanation) it is more or less agreed that it wasn't a constellation, a comet, a nova,<br> 
            or a supernova. Star of Bethlehem hunters are still looking at possible and unusual planetary conjunctions<br> 
            to explain it. That said, within the Christian narrative, perhaps the explanation is far more entrenched<br> 
            in divine metaphysics than anything else. Edward Burne-Jones, an associate of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood,<br> 
            painted the Star of Bethlehem held in the hands of an angel.

            Sometimes it's permissible to simply bathe in the wonderment of observable space! We look up at the sky,<br> 
            day or night, and see an array of beautiful objects ranging from clouds and the sun to planets and stars.<br> 
            What's not to love? Van Gogh was inspired to create The Starry Night whilst recuperating in an asylum having<br> 
            amputated his own ear. It is a reminder that even out of the most abject pain beauty can still emerge.
