            Traditionally the sun and the moon have masculine and feminine traits respectively. 
            This was certainly true in Greek mythology. Selene was a Titan goddess, daughter of 
            Hyperion and Theia, and sister to Helios (the sun god) and Eos (the goddess of the dawn). 
            Selene (her Roman equivalent is Luna) drove a silver moon chariot across the sky each night. 
            The moon is mysterious and understated, yet ominous and highly charged. Apply these qualities 
            to a woman and the more uneasy among us will reply with words such as unreliable or mercurial, 
            yet the moon has a firm path of growth and decline that never fails. In these phases can be 
            perceived the many complex characteristics that allude to the feminine.

            What about stars? The most talked-about star at this time of year is of course the Star of Bethlehem. 
            While the jury doesn't seem to be out on this subject (rather there doesn't seem to be an obvious 
            science-based explanation) it is more or less agreed that it wasn't a constellation, a comet, a nova, 
            or a supernova. Star of Bethlehem hunters are still looking at possible and unusual planetary conjunctions 
            to explain it. That said, within the Christian narrative, perhaps the explanation is far more entrenched 
            in divine metaphysics than anything else. Edward Burne-Jones, an associate of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, 
            painted the Star of Bethlehem held in the hands of an angel.

            Sometimes it's permissible to simply bathe in the wonderment of observable space! We look up at the sky, 
            day or night, and see an array of beautiful objects ranging from clouds and the sun to planets and stars. 
            What's not to love? Van Gogh was inspired to create The Starry Night whilst recuperating in an asylum having 
            amputated his own ear. It is a reminder that even out of the most abject pain beauty can still emerge.
