        <h1>Secrets of Vermeer</h1> 
        <p>“It is like looking over the artist's shoulder as he works,” says Wieseman.<br> 
            “The imaging lab process is'Why does this section of the painting look like this?'<br> 
            And then to get an answer from colleagues who really know the science.<br> 
            There is such synergy in the room, working with colleagues at the top of their game,<br> 
            the depth of experience and creative thinking, it's like there's a thousand years<br> 
            of brain power involved. It's just incredible to be a part of that.” Besides Delaney,<br> 
            Dooley, and Wieseman, the team includes associate painting conservator Dina Anchin,<br> 
            research conservator of painting technology Melanie Gifford, conservation scientist<br> 
            Lisha Glinsman, and associate curator of Northern European paintings Alexandra Libby.</p>

            The surface of a Vermeer such as the National Gallery's Woman Holding a Balance<br> 
            still looks “perfect and inevitable,” Wieseman explains. But microscopic examination<br> 
            of the museum's Vermeers conducted since the 1990s have shown that Vermeer worked in<br> 
            discrete stages. The most recent analyses offer more complete images of these stages<br> 
            in the painting process. Beneath the finished exterior, scientists are now able to<br> 
            provide images of the preparatory sketch (a monochrome painted sketch) and the underpaint.

            Here is the revelation that left the team wide-eyed. Under the surface, they can<br> 
            see evidence of quick, sketchy, spontaneous, and sometimes thickly textured brushstrokes.<br> 
            It's as if Vermeer shifted elements around in an impetuous process of discovery, trying<br> 
            and rejecting different approaches—the opposite of the painstakingly slow perfectionist<br> 
            who proceeded molecule by molecule to achieve the timeless beauty of his finished surface.<br> 
            So, what makes a Vermeer a Vermeer? An initial energetic, inspired, creative phase, it seems.<br> 
            For Vermeer, arriving at that signature effervescent depiction of light turns out to have <br>
            been a complex, multiphase journey, creating and revising layers that serve as a foundation <br>
            for the finished work we see today. Thanks to the team's latest advanced scientific analysis,<br> 
            it may be time to reevaluate Vermeer's technique. And perhaps Vermeer himself.<br>
