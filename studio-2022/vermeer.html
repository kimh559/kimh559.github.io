        <h1><center>Secrets of Vermeer</center></h1>
        <p>“It is like looking over the artist's shoulder as he works,” says Wieseman. “The imaging lab process is<br>
            amazing to me—I nearly flunked chemistry in high school. But here, to toss out a curator's question like,<br> 
            'Why does this section of the painting look like this?' And then to get an answer from colleagues who <br>
            really know the science. There is such synergy in the room, working with colleagues at the top of their game,<br> 
            the depth of experience and creative thinking, it's like there's a thousand years of brain power involved.<br> 
            It's just incredible to be a part of that.” Besides Delaney, Dooley, and Wieseman, the team includes associate <br>
            painting conservator Dina Anchin, research conservator of painting technology Melanie Gifford, conservation<br> 
            scientist Lisha Glinsman, and associate curator of Northern European paintings Alexandra Libby.</p>

            The surface of a Vermeer such as the National Gallery's Woman Holding a Balance still looks “perfect and inevitable,”<br> 
            Wieseman explains. But microscopic examination of the museum's Vermeers conducted since the 1990s have shown that Vermeer<br> 
            worked in discrete stages. The most recent analyses offer more complete images of these stages in the painting process.<br>
            Beneath the finished exterior, scientists are now able to provide images of the preparatory sketch <br>
            (a monochrome painted sketch) and the underpaint.

            Here is the revelation that left the team wide-eyed. Under the surface, they can see evidence of quick, sketchy, spontaneous,<br> 
            and sometimes thickly textured brushstrokes. It's as if Vermeer shifted elements around in an impetuous process of discovery,<br> 
            trying and rejecting different approaches—the opposite of the painstakingly slow perfectionist who proceeded molecule by molecule<br> 
            to achieve the timeless beauty of his finished surface. So, what makes a Vermeer a Vermeer? An initial energetic, inspired,<br> 
            creative phase, it seems. For Vermeer, arriving at that signature effervescent depiction of light turns out to have been a<br> 
            complex, multiphase journey, creating and revising layers that serve as a foundation for the finished work we see today.<br> 
            Thanks to the team's latest advanced scientific analysis, it may be time to reevaluate Vermeer's technique.<br> 
            And perhaps Vermeer himself.
