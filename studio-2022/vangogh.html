            Traditionally the sun and the moon have masculine and<br> 
            feminine traits respectively. This was certainly true<br> 
            in Greek mythology. Selene was a Titan goddess, daughter<br> 
            of Hyperion and Theia, and sister to Helios (the sun god)<br> 
            and Eos (the goddess of the dawn). Selene (her Roman<br> 
            equivalent is Luna) drove a silver moon chariot across<br> 
            the sky each night. The moon is mysterious and understated,<br> 
            yet ominous and highly charged. Apply these qualities to a<br> 
            woman and the more uneasy among us will reply with words<br> 
            such as unreliable or mercurial, yet the moon has a firm<br> 
            path of growth and decline that never fails. In these phases<br> 
            can be perceived the many complex characteristics that <br>
            allude to the feminine.

            What about stars? The most talked-about star at this time<br> 
            of year is of course the Star of Bethlehem. While the jury<br> 
            doesn't seem to be out on this subject (rather there doesn't<br> 
            seem to be an obvious science-based explanation) it is more<br> 
            or less agreed that it wasn't a constellation, a comet, a nova,<br> 
            or a supernova. Star of Bethlehem hunters are still looking at<br> 
            possible and unusual planetary conjunctions to explain it.<br> 
            That said, within the Christian narrative, perhaps the<br> 
            explanation is far more entrenched in divine metaphysics<br> 
            than anything else. Edward Burne-Jones, an associate of<br> 
            the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, painted the Star of Bethlehem<br> 
            held in the hands of an angel.

            Sometimes it's permissible to simply bathe in the wonderment<br>
            of observable space! We look up at the sky, day or night,<br> 
            and see an array of beautiful objects ranging from clouds<br> 
            and the sun to planets and stars. What's not to love?<br> 
            Van Gogh was inspired to create The Starry Night whilst<br> 
            recuperating in an asylum having amputated his own ear.<br> 
            It is a reminder that even out of the most abject pain<br> 
            beauty can still emerge.
