        <h1>Secrets of Vermeer</h1> 
        <p>“It is like looking over the artist's shoulder as he works,”<br> 
            says Wieseman. “The imaging lab process is'Why does this<br> 
            section of the painting look like this?' And then to get<br> 
            an answer from colleagues who really know the science.<br> 
            There is such synergy in the room, working with colleagues<br> 
            at the top of their game, the depth of experience and creative<br> 
            thinking, it's like there's a thousand years of brain power<br> 
            involved. It's just incredible to be a part of that.” Besides<br> 
            Delaney, Dooley, and Wieseman, the team includes associate<br> 
            painting conservator Dina Anchin, research conservator of<br> 
            painting technology Melanie Gifford, conservation scientist<br> 
            Lisha Glinsman, and associate curator of Northern European<br> 
            paintings Alexandra Libby.</p>

            "The surface of a Vermeer such as the National Gallery's<br> 
            Woman Holding a Balance still looks “perfect and inevitable,”<br> 
            Wieseman explains. But microscopic examination of the museum's<br> 
            Vermeers conducted since the 1990s have shown that Vermeer <br>
            worked in discrete stages. The most recent analyses offer<br> 
            more complete images of these stages in the painting process.<br> 
            Beneath the finished exterior, scientists are now able to<br> 
            provide images of the preparatory sketch (a monochrome<br> 
            painted sketch) and the underpaint.<br>

            <p id="vermeer">perfect. discrete. monochrome.</p>
        <p>
            Here is the revelation that left the team wide-eyed.<br> 
            Under the surface, they can see evidence of quick,<br> 
            sketchy, spontaneous, and sometimes thickly textured<br> 
            brushstrokes. It's as if Vermeer shifted elements<br> 
            around in an impetuous process of discovery, trying <br>
            and rejecting different approaches—the opposite of<br> 
            the painstakingly slow perfectionist who proceeded<br> 
            molecule by molecule to achieve the timeless beauty<br> 
            of his finished surface. So, what makes a Vermeer<br> 
            a Vermeer? An initial energetic, inspired, creative<br> 
            phase, it seems. For Vermeer, arriving at that<br> 
            signature effervescent depiction of light turns<br> 
            out to have been a complex, multiphase journey,<br> 
            creating and revising layers that serve as a <br>
            foundation for the finished work we see today.<br> 
            Thanks to the team's latest advanced scientific<br> 
            analysis, it may be time to reevaluate Vermeer's<br> 
            technique. And perhaps Vermeer himself.
