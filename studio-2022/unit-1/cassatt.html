        <h1>Reflections on Mary Cassatt</h1>
        <p>
            Mary Stevenson Cassatt was an American painter<br> 
            and printmaker. She lived much of her adult<br> 
            life in France, where she became friends with<br> 
            Edgar Degas and later exhibited among the<br> 
            Impressionists as one of “les trois grandes<br> 
            dames” (the three great ladies). She was famous<br> 
            for creating images of the social and private<br> 
            lives of women, with particular emphasis on the<br> 
            intimate bonds between mothers and children.<br> 
            Little Girl in a Blue Armchair is one of her<br> 
            most important works. The painting was possibly<br> 
            shown at the Fourth Impressionist Exhibition 1879<br> 
            as Portrait de petite fille. At that time Cassatt<br> 
            was in conflict with the official French art<br> 
            establishment and had her submissions rejected<br> 
            by the official Salon. It was no deal for her<br> 
            when Edgar Degas invited her to join the <br>
            Impressionists.

            The painting, dazzling with its predominant<br> 
            hue of deep turquoise, was purchased from <br>
            the artist by Ambroise Vollard of Paris<br> 
            around 1903 for his gallery, and was later<br> 
            acquired by Hector Brame of Paris. It was<br> 
            sold in 1963 to Mr. and Mrs. Paul Mellon.<br> 
            They lent it to the National Gallery of Art<br> 
            for exhibitions and eventually gifted it in<br> 
            1983 to NGA. For Griselda Pollock, a visual<br> 
            theorist, cultural analyst and scholar of<br> 
            international, postcolonial feminist studies<br> 
            in the visual arts, it is one of the most<br> 
            radical images of childhood of the time.<br> 
            It may be true. Cassatt herself once wrote:<br> 
            “I love to paint children...<br> 
            They are so natural and truthful.”<br>
