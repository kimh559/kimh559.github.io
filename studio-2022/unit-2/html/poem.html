        <h2><center>The Starry Night by Anne Sexton</center></h2>
        <div id="paragraph"><p><center>
            The town does not exist<br>
            except where one black-haired tree slips<br>
            up like a drowned woman into the hot sky.<br>
            The town is silent. The night boils with eleven stars.<br>
            Oh starry starry night! This is how<br>
            I want to die.<br>
            <br>
            It moves. They are all alive.<br>
            Even the moon bulges in its orange irons<br>
            to push childre, like a god, from its eye.<br>
            The old unseen serpent swallows up the stars.<br>
            Oh starry starry night! This is how<br>
            I want to die:<br>
            <br>
            into that rushing beast of the night,<br>
            sucked up by that great dragon, to split<br>
            from my life with no flag<br>
            no belly,<br>
            no cry.<br>
        </center></p></div>
