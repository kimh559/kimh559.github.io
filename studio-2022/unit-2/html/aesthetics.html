            "These last three months do seem so strange to me. Sometimes moods of indescribable mental anguish,<br>
            sometimes moments when the veil of time and the fatality of circumstances seemed to be torn apart<br>
            for an instant." —Vincent van Gogh in an excerpt from a letter he penned to his brother Theo in 1889.<br>
            <br>
            In late 1888, Vincent van Gogh began to experience moments of mania and violent aggression. His friend,<br>
            Paul Gauguin--another brilliant artist--was staying with Van Gogh and said that even he noticed his<br>
            strange and scary behavior. The exact details of what really happened aren't known for sure, but what <br>
            is clear is Van Gogh was struggling with some inner-demons that manifested themselves in gruesome fashion.<br>
            Yes, I'm referring to when he cut his ear off with a razor and had it delivered to a woman at a brothel he<br>
            and Gauguin liked to frequent.<br>
            <br>
            After being found unconscious by police the next morning, he was taken to a local hospital in Arles where<br>
            he was treated. It was then that Van Gogh was diagnosed as experiencing "acute mania with generalised delirium".<br>
            From there, the downward spiral began and eventually, Van Gogh checked himself into an asylum in Saint Rémy de<br>
            Provence, the birthplace of Nostradamus. His room faced the east and it is said that he was so inspired by the<br>
            view, he churned out numerous paintings and drawings of it. This is one of those paintings.<br>
            <br>
            The Starry Night, by Vincent Willem van Gogh (1853-1890), is an oil on canvas, post-impressionist painting which<br>
            was completed in 1889. It depicts the French town of Saint-Rémy-de-Provence where he resided as a patient at a<br>
            local asylum. There he had a studio on the ground floor, and a bedroom on the second floor. Of the more than<br>
            twenty-one paintings Van Gogh did from the asylum, this is one of the most famous and obviously one of the most<br>
            well-known pieces in history. Since the scene with the cypress tree in the foreground and hill-line in the background<br>
            has been verified to be of the view from his bedroom window, and he was not allowed to use paint in his bedroom, it is<br>
            believed that he first sketched this piece using charcoal or ink on paper, and then later painted it in his studio. The<br>
            brightest star just to the right of the tree is actually Venus which astronomers have verified was visible at that time<br>
            in that region. What's not completely accurate, however, is view of the town (which was not visible from the asylum), and<br>
            the waning crescent moon which was actually waning gibbous at that time. Experts feel he used previous drawings or paintings<br>
            to add in the town, and gave an artistic interpretation of the moon.<br>
            <br>
            Imperfections and speculation aside, what is powerful about this piece is the dancing, swirling colors and seeming serenity<br>
            the painting gives off. There's a certain tranquility about it, and at first glance, one feels at peace and in awe of this<br>
            giant universe. Looking deeper at the details, though, I get a clear sense of his madness. When I inspected an extremely<br>
            high-resolution version of this piece, there was something about the dark lines and angles of the buildings that spoke to<br>
            me. They seemed to portray Van Gogh's mania in the way he appears to have obsessed over the detail. What's even more frightening<br>
            are two of the lit windows just below and to the right of the church. Though there are a handful of windows glowing from candlelight,<br>
            those two in particular appear to have ghostly figures in them looking his direction - figures similar to Skrik. I don't take them to<br>
            be a fluke, either, because in great detail, you can see how much he labored to get the brush strokes and coloring just right. I also<br>
            contrast this detail with the fact that the window to the church is stark black indicating that no one is there.<br>
            <br>
            Any form of mental disorder is no joke so I don't share these impressions lightly. Van Gogh is easily one of my most favorite artists<br>
            of all time, and though I am not a fan of all of his pieces, this particular one was one of the first I learned about when I was a kid<br>
            and my passion for art began to grow. To me, it's awe-inspiring, and it's also a metaphor for human life. On the surface and at quick<br>
            glance, many seem okay and to be moving along in life in rhythmic harmony. Like the waves of color swirling in the night sky, we dance<br>
            and sway through each day never letting on about what's really going on in the dark recesses of our minds. But when you examine things<br>
            more closely, you begin to see the brokenness and fear. In a way, I think this is what makes this painting all the more beautiful because<br>
            it isn't just about oil paints on a canvas, but an example of how all of us can be at one time or another. Am I stretching a bit here?<br>
            Sure, you can say that. Am I accurate in my interpretation? Who knows? But that's how The Starry Night speaks to me and that's why art<br>
            exists. It stirs our minds and imaginations. It speaks to us . . . and when it speaks to me, I really want to listen.</p></div>
