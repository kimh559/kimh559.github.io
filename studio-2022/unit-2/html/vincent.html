        <h2><center>Vincent (Starry, Starry Night) by Josh Groban</center></h2>
        <div id="paragraph"><p>
            Starry, starry night<br>
            Paint your pallet blue and gray<br>
            Look out on the summer's day<br>
            With eyes that know the darkness in my soul<br>
            Shadows on the hills<br>
            Sketch the trees and daffodils<br>
            Catch the breeze and winter chill<br>
            In colors on the snowy linen land<br>
            <br>
            Now I understand<br>
            What you tired to say to me<br>
            And how you suffered for your sanity<br>
            And how you tried to set them free<br>
            They would not listen<br>
            The did not know how<br>
            Perhaps they'll listen now<br>
            <br>
            Starry, starry night<br>
            Flaming flowers that brightly blaze<br>
            Swirling clouds in violet haze<br>
            Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue<br>
            Colors changing hue<br>
            Morning fields of amber gray<br>
            Weathered faces lined in pain<br>
            Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand<br>
            <br>
            Now I understand<br> 
            What you tried to say to me<br>
            And how you suffered for your sanity<br>
            And how you tried to set them free<br>
            They would not listen<br>
            They did not know how<br>
            Perhaps they'll listen now<br>
            <br>
            For they could not love you<br>
            But still your love was true<br>
            And when your love was left inside<br>
            On that starry, starry night<br>
            You took your life as lovers often do<br>
            But I could have told you, Vincent<br>
            This world was never meant for one<br>
            As beautiful as you<br>
            <br>
            Like the strangers that you've met<br>
            The ragged men in ragged clothes<br>
            The silver thorn, a bloody rose<br>
            Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow<br>
            <br>
            Now I think I know<br>
            What you tried to say to me<br>
            And how you suffered for your sanity<br>
            And how you tried to set them free<br>
            They would not listen<br>
            They're not listening still<br>
            Perhaps they never will<br>
