        <h2><center>Starry Night (short fiction)</center></h2>
        <div id="paragraph"><p>"I know nothing with any certainty, but the sigh of the stars makes me dream," Vincent Van Gogh said that.<br>
            He had always been my uncle's favorite artist, you could find his work just about anywhere on the walls <br>
            of his house. I used to spend hours looking at the vibrant splotches of paint, studying the way they seemed<br>
            to swirl around the canvas.<br>
            <br>
            There is just something about Van Gogh isn't there? He is not quite like any artist. His paintings are not<br>
            just images, they are depictions that seem to glow with the luminescence of life. They touch your soul. I<br>
            felt I could relate to Vincent, the way he had given up his whole life to art in an almost fanatic obsession,<br>
            not caring that he never saw any success. Not to mention the way he stumbled around most of the time confused<br>
            and half insane. Yup, that was definitely me.<br>
            <br>
            But why am I thinking about Vincent Van Gogh anyway? Looking up I see the twinkling lights in the sky and found<br>
            I was grateful for them. It is good that such an inky abyss is textured with stars, at least it gives some variation<br>
            to eternity. I guess that is why I was thinking of Van Gogh, how could you look at a starry night and not think of him?<br>
            <br>
            He had after all been the one to perfectly capture her essence, giving form to the feeling of countless people.<br>
            Suddenly we could look up and not feel so alone. The vast array of humanity drifting about in the universe connected<br>
            as if spooled together with an ethereal string. I reached up and tapped my knuckles on my forehead, where were all<br>
            these abstract thoughts coming from? Probably, they were a defense mechanism. My mind is trying to avoid a breakdown<br>
            by distracting itself with empty daydreams.<br>
            <br>
            It didn't change anything. My parents and grandparents were still waiting inside, and sooner or later I would have to<br>
            go in and tell them. Still, maybe a little longer out here. Just me and the stars.<br></p></div>
