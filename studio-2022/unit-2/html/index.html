            <h3 id="beauty"><center>The Beauty of Starry Night</center></h3>
            <p>Ever since I was little, art has allowed imagination run wild. As someone who actively enjoys making and viewing art,<br>
               I can relate to Vincent van Gogh's emotions while he was painting because my emotions drive my art as well. I remember<br>
               seeing The Starry Night for the first time, and I was transfixed by its swirls and stars and by the emotions I felt<br>
               within myself. I look to the swirls and the sky, and I feel like I am floating on the cool midnight current of the<br>
               small, articulate brushstrokes. I look at the stars and I feel their radiating light through the warmth of their<br>
               bright color. I see the black cypress tree, with its branches erupting upwards to the sky, and I tell myself that<br>
               dark times cannot destroy me. I see the ordinary town and I am reminded to never forget where I came from. Every<br>
               time I see the painting, I still feel the same emotions.<br>
               <br>
               During the Post-Impressionist era, Vincent van Gogh painted The Starry Night while in Asylum at Saint-Remy in 1889.<br>
               The painting is considered the third part of a series that is preceded by Starry Night over the Rhone and Cafe Terrace<br>
               at Night, both of which also include a starry night sky. What makes The Starry Night so appealing? Is it the way the<br>
               stars shine? Or the contrast between the bright sky and the cypress tree? For me, it is the undeniable magic that all<br>
               art can conveys: emotion told by the the artist to the viewer.<br>
               <br>
               While Vincent van Gogh was working on the painting, Vincent and Theo, his brother, exchanged many letters, in which<br>
               they discussed painting and art, but van Gogh never addressed his work in detail, and The Starry Night was no different.<br>
               In one letter he wrote, “This morning I saw the country from my window a long time before sunrise, with nothing but the<br>
               morning star, which looked very big.” He mentions in another letter that he began “a new study of a starry sky” and “It<br>
               is not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas… more than is apparent, by colour and a more spontaneous drawing<br>
               than delusive accuracy, one could express the purer nature of a countryside…” (Letter 595). Vincent van Gogh did not<br>
               want The Starry Night to be romantic or religious or accurate. The countryside captured van Gogh, and he wanted to<br>
               capture it back in oil perfection. This may have been the inspiration for The Starry Night, but he never goes in<br>
               depth with his thoughts.<br>
               <br>
               It is no secret that van Gogh was not fazed by the thought of death. He once told his brother Theo, “The difference<br>
               between happiness and unhappiness! Both are necessary and useful, as well as death and disappearance…it is so relative<br>
               and life is the same” (Letter 607). His outlook of death is apparent in The Starry Night with the cypress tree, which<br>
               is traditionally aligned with graveyards and mourning. The cypress tree connecting the stars ties directly with what<br>
               van Gogh said, “Why, I ask myself, shouldn't the shining dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the<br>
               map of France? Just as we take the train to get to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death to reach a star” (MoMA).<br>
               The cypress tree is the death train to reach the starry map of the night sky. In this sense, we as viewers<br>
               can connect with the artist's emotions towards death. As we grow as people, life goes on and we begin to die.<br>
               As we die, we reach for the stars, much like the cypress tree.<br>
               <br>
               As van Gogh stated, “It is not the language of painters but the language of nature which one should listen to...<br>
               The feeling for the things themselves, for reality, is more important than the feeling for pictures” (Vincent van<br>
               Gogh Gallery). This is evident in The Starry Night in the way van Gogh feels the need to have more “spontaneous drawing”<br>
               instead of “delusive accuracy” of what the scene really looks like, which allows for true feelings to be seen in between<br>
               the strokes of the paintbrush from the moon, to the town, to the cypress tree. Not only does he take his own advice while<br>
               he paints, but he also reminds other artists that listening to themselves and feeling nature is more important than trying<br>
               to create a masterpiece without any imperfections. This impacts me because I am both an artist and a perfectionist, which<br>
               is a difficult combination at times as I struggle to capture what I see before me. I have figured out that, although my<br>
               particular work doesn't look like what others see, it is something that captivated me. Just because it isn't perfectly<br>
               accurate, I know that my emotions are on the canvas. At the end of the day is that what art is all about? Emotion?<br>
               <br>
               Some people may just see a blue swirled sky, a yellow moon with glowing orbs, and a black flame-like thing on the left side.<br>
               If that's all that people saw, then it wouldn't be the most famous painting in the world. With The Starry Night, Vincent van<br>
               Gogh must have done something right to appeal to the entire human population. There is no disputing that the painting is truly<br>
               a work of art, but there is more to it than just pretty colors. Past the stars, traveling through the currents of the paint,<br>
               reaching farther than the cypress, is the heart of art, which is emotion. It is one thing to feel something while you create<br>
               art, it is another to invoke emotions in the viewer as well. To do both, well...that is magical.<br></p>
