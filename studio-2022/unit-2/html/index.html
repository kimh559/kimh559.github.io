            <div id="modal1"><a href="#">Close</a>"I know nothing with any certainty, but the sigh of the stars makes me dream". Vincent Van Gogh said that. 
                                                He had always been my uncle's favorite artist, you could find his work just about anywhere on the walls of 
                                                his house. I used to spend hours looking at the vibrant splotches of paint, studying the way they seemed to 
                                                swirl around the canvas.<br><br> There is just something about Van Gogh isn't there? He is not quite like any 
                                                artist. His paintings are not just images, they are depictions that seem to glow with the luminescence of 
                                                life. They touch your soul. I felt I could relate to Vincent, the way he had given up his whole life to art 
                                                in an almost fanatic obsession, not caring that he never saw any success. Not to mention the way he stumbled 
                                                around most of the time confused and half insane. Yup, that was definitely me.<br><br> But why am I thinking about 
                                                Vincent Van Gogh anyway? Looking up I see the twinkling lights in the sky and found I was grateful for them. It 
                                                is good that such an inky abyss is textured with stars, at least it gives some variation to eternity. I guess 
                                                that is why I was thinking of Van Gogh, how could you look at a starry night and not think of him?<br><br> He had 
                                                after all been the one to perfectly capture her essence, giving form to the feeling of countless people. Suddenly 
                                                we could look up and not feel so alone. The vast array of humanity drifting about in the universe connected as if 
                                                spooled together with an ethereal string.<br><br> I reached up and tapped my knuckles on my forehead, where were all 
                                                these abstract thoughts coming from? Probably, they were a defense mechanism. My mind is trying to avoid a breakdown 
                                                by distracting itself with empty daydreams.<br><br> It didn't change anything. My parents and grandparents were still 
                                                waiting inside, and sooner or later I would have to go in and tell them. Still, maybe a little longer out here.
                                                Just me and the stars.<br></div>
