            <div id="modal1"><a href="#">Close</a>"I know nothing with any certainty, but the sigh of the stars makes me dream". Vincent Van Gogh said that. 
                                                He had always been my uncle's favorite artist, you could find his work just about anywhere on the walls of 
                                                his house. I used to spend hours looking at the vibrant splotches of paint, studying the way they seemed to 
                                                swirl around the canvas.<br><br> There is just something about Van Gogh isn't there? He is not quite like any 
                                                artist. His paintings are not just images, they are depictions that seem to glow with the luminescence of 
                                                life. They touch your soul. I felt I could relate to Vincent, the way he had given up his whole life to art 
                                                in an almost fanatic obsession, not caring that he never saw any success. Not to mention the way he stumbled 
                                                around most of the time confused and half insane. Yup, that was definitely me.<br><br> But why am I thinking about 
                                                Vincent Van Gogh anyway? Looking up I see the twinkling lights in the sky and found I was grateful for them. It 
                                                is good that such an inky abyss is textured with stars, at least it gives some variation to eternity. I guess 
                                                that is why I was thinking of Van Gogh, how could you look at a starry night and not think of him?<br><br> He had 
                                                after all been the one to perfectly capture her essence, giving form to the feeling of countless people. Suddenly 
                                                we could look up and not feel so alone. The vast array of humanity drifting about in the universe connected as if 
                                                spooled together with an ethereal string.<br><br> I reached up and tapped my knuckles on my forehead, where were all 
                                                these abstract thoughts coming from? Probably, they were a defense mechanism. My mind is trying to avoid a breakdown 
                                                by distracting itself with empty daydreams.<br><br> It didn't change anything. My parents and grandparents were still 
                                                waiting inside, and sooner or later I would have to go in and tell them. Still, maybe a little longer out here.
                                                Just me and the stars.<br></div>

                                                  "These last three months do seem so strange to me. Sometimes moods of indescribable mental anguish,
                                                  sometimes moments when the veil of time and the fatality of circumstances seemed to be torn apart
                                                  for an instant." —Vincent van Gogh in an excerpt from a letter he penned to his brother Theo in 1889.<br><br>
                                                  In late 1888, Vincent van Gogh began to experience moments of mania and violent aggression. His friend,
                                                  Paul Gauguin--another brilliant artist--was staying with Van Gogh and said that even he noticed his
                                                  strange and scary behavior. The exact details of what really happened aren't known for sure, but what 
                                                  is clear is Van Gogh was struggling with some inner-demons that manifested themselves in gruesome fashion.
                                                  Yes, I'm referring to when he cut his ear off with a razor and had it delivered to a woman at a brothel he
                                                  and Gauguin liked to frequent.<br><br>
                                                  After being found unconscious by police the next morning, he was taken to a local hospital in Arles where
                                                  he was treated. It was then that Van Gogh was diagnosed as experiencing "acute mania with generalised delirium".
                                                  From there, the downward spiral began and eventually, Van Gogh checked himself into an asylum in Saint Rémy de
                                                  Provence, the birthplace of Nostradamus. His room faced the east and it is said that he was so inspired by the
                                                  view, he churned out numerous paintings and drawings of it. This is one of those paintings.<br><br>
                                                  The Starry Night, by Vincent Willem van Gogh (1853-1890), is an oil on canvas, post-impressionist painting which
                                                  was completed in 1889. It depicts the French town of Saint-Rémy-de-Provence where he resided as a patient at a
                                                  local asylum. There he had a studio on the ground floor, and a bedroom on the second floor. Of the more than
                                                  twenty-one paintings Van Gogh did from the asylum, this is one of the most famous and obviously one of the most
                                                  well-known pieces in history. Since the scene with the cypress tree in the foreground and hill-line in the background
                                                  has been verified to be of the view from his bedroom window, and he was not allowed to use paint in his bedroom, it is
                                                  believed that he first sketched this piece using charcoal or ink on paper, and then later painted it in his studio. The
                                                  brightest star just to the right of the tree is actually Venus which astronomers have verified was visible at that time
                                                  in that region. What's not completely accurate, however, is view of the town (which was not visible from the asylum), and
                                                  the waning crescent moon which was actually waning gibbous at that time. Experts feel he used previous drawings or paintings
                                                  to add in the town, and gave an artistic interpretation of the moon.<br><br>
                                                  Imperfections and speculation aside, what is powerful about this piece is the dancing, swirling colors and seeming serenity
                                                  the painting gives off. There's a certain tranquility about it, and at first glance, one feels at peace and in awe of this
                                                  giant universe. Looking deeper at the details, though, I get a clear sense of his madness. When I inspected an extremely
                                                  high-resolution version of this piece, there was something about the dark lines and angles of the buildings that spoke to
                                                  me. They seemed to portray Van Gogh's mania in the way he appears to have obsessed over the detail. What's even more frightening
                                                  are two of the lit windows just below and to the right of the church. Though there are a handful of windows glowing from candlelight,
                                                  those two in particular appear to have ghostly figures in them looking his direction - figures similar to Skrik. I don't take them to
                                                  be a fluke, either, because in great detail, you can see how much he labored to get the brush strokes and coloring just right. I also
                                                  contrast this detail with the fact that the window to the church is stark black indicating that no one is there.<br><br>
                                                  Any form of mental disorder is no joke so I don't share these impressions lightly. Van Gogh is easily one of my most favorite artists
                                                  of all time, and though I am not a fan of all of his pieces, this particular one was one of the first I learned about when I was a kid
                                                  and my passion for art began to grow. To me, it's awe-inspiring, and it's also a metaphor for human life. On the surface and at quick
                                                  glance, many seem okay and to be moving along in life in rhythmic harmony. Like the waves of color swirling in the night sky, we dance
                                                  and sway through each day never letting on about what's really going on in the dark recesses of our minds. But when you examine things
                                                  more closely, you begin to see the brokenness and fear. In a way, I think this is what makes this painting all the more beautiful because
                                                  it isn't just about oil paints on a canvas, but an example of how all of us can be at one time or another. Am I stretching a bit here?
                                                  Sure, you can say that. Am I accurate in my interpretation? Who knows? But that's how The Starry Night speaks to me and that's why art
                                                  exists. It stirs our minds and imaginations. It speaks to us . . . and when it speaks to me, I really want to listen.<br></div>
