            <div class="modal1" id="modal1"><a href="#" class="js-close-modal1"></a>"I know nothing with any certainty, but the sigh of the stars makes me dream". Vincent Van Gogh said that. 
                                                He had always been my uncle's favorite artist, you could find his work just about anywhere on the walls of 
                                                his house. I used to spend hours looking at the vibrant splotches of paint, studying the way they seemed to 
                                                swirl around the canvas.<br><br> There is just something about Van Gogh isn't there? He is not quite like any 
                                                artist. His paintings are not just images, they are depictions that seem to glow with the luminescence of 
                                                life. They touch your soul. I felt I could relate to Vincent, the way he had given up his whole life to art 
                                                in an almost fanatic obsession, not caring that he never saw any success. Not to mention the way he stumbled 
                                                around most of the time confused and half insane. Yup, that was definitely me.<br><br> But why am I thinking about 
                                                Vincent Van Gogh anyway? Looking up I see the twinkling lights in the sky and found I was grateful for them. It 
                                                is good that such an inky abyss is textured with stars, at least it gives some variation to eternity. I guess 
                                                that is why I was thinking of Van Gogh, how could you look at a starry night and not think of him?<br><br> He had 
                                                after all been the one to perfectly capture her essence, giving form to the feeling of countless people. Suddenly 
                                                we could look up and not feel so alone. The vast array of humanity drifting about in the universe connected as if 
                                                spooled together with an ethereal string.<br><br> I reached up and tapped my knuckles on my forehead, where were all 
                                                these abstract thoughts coming from? Probably, they were a defense mechanism. My mind is trying to avoid a breakdown 
                                                by distracting itself with empty daydreams.<br><br> It didn't change anything. My parents and grandparents were still 
                                                waiting inside, and sooner or later I would have to go in and tell them. Still, maybe a little longer out here.
                                                Just me and the stars.<br></div>

                                                  "These last three months do seem so strange to me. Sometimes moods of indescribable mental anguish,
                                                  sometimes moments when the veil of time and the fatality of circumstances seemed to be torn apart
                                                  for an instant." —Vincent van Gogh in an excerpt from a letter he penned to his brother Theo in 1889.<br><br>
                                                  In late 1888, Vincent van Gogh began to experience moments of mania and violent aggression. His friend,
                                                  Paul Gauguin--another brilliant artist--was staying with Van Gogh and said that even he noticed his
                                                  strange and scary behavior. The exact details of what really happened aren't known for sure, but what 
                                                  is clear is Van Gogh was struggling with some inner-demons that manifested themselves in gruesome fashion.
                                                  Yes, I'm referring to when he cut his ear off with a razor and had it delivered to a woman at a brothel he
                                                  and Gauguin liked to frequent.<br><br>
                                                  After being found unconscious by police the next morning, he was taken to a local hospital in Arles where
                                                  he was treated. It was then that Van Gogh was diagnosed as experiencing "acute mania with generalised delirium".
                                                  From there, the downward spiral began and eventually, Van Gogh checked himself into an asylum in Saint Rémy de
                                                  Provence, the birthplace of Nostradamus. His room faced the east and it is said that he was so inspired by the
                                                  view, he churned out numerous paintings and drawings of it. This is one of those paintings.<br><br>
                                                  The Starry Night, by Vincent Willem van Gogh (1853-1890), is an oil on canvas, post-impressionist painting which
                                                  was completed in 1889. It depicts the French town of Saint-Rémy-de-Provence where he resided as a patient at a
                                                  local asylum. There he had a studio on the ground floor, and a bedroom on the second floor. Of the more than
                                                  twenty-one paintings Van Gogh did from the asylum, this is one of the most famous and obviously one of the most
                                                  well-known pieces in history. Since the scene with the cypress tree in the foreground and hill-line in the background
                                                  has been verified to be of the view from his bedroom window, and he was not allowed to use paint in his bedroom, it is
                                                  believed that he first sketched this piece using charcoal or ink on paper, and then later painted it in his studio. The
                                                  brightest star just to the right of the tree is actually Venus which astronomers have verified was visible at that time
                                                  in that region. What's not completely accurate, however, is view of the town (which was not visible from the asylum), and
                                                  the waning crescent moon which was actually waning gibbous at that time. Experts feel he used previous drawings or paintings
                                                  to add in the town, and gave an artistic interpretation of the moon.<br><br>
                                                  Imperfections and speculation aside, what is powerful about this piece is the dancing, swirling colors and seeming serenity
                                                  the painting gives off. There's a certain tranquility about it, and at first glance, one feels at peace and in awe of this
                                                  giant universe. Looking deeper at the details, though, I get a clear sense of his madness. When I inspected an extremely
                                                  high-resolution version of this piece, there was something about the dark lines and angles of the buildings that spoke to
                                                  me. They seemed to portray Van Gogh's mania in the way he appears to have obsessed over the detail. What's even more frightening
                                                  are two of the lit windows just below and to the right of the church. Though there are a handful of windows glowing from candlelight,
                                                  those two in particular appear to have ghostly figures in them looking his direction - figures similar to Skrik. I don't take them to
                                                  be a fluke, either, because in great detail, you can see how much he labored to get the brush strokes and coloring just right. I also
                                                  contrast this detail with the fact that the window to the church is stark black indicating that no one is there.<br><br>
                                                  Any form of mental disorder is no joke so I don't share these impressions lightly. Van Gogh is easily one of my most favorite artists
                                                  of all time, and though I am not a fan of all of his pieces, this particular one was one of the first I learned about when I was a kid
                                                  and my passion for art began to grow. To me, it's awe-inspiring, and it's also a metaphor for human life. On the surface and at quick
                                                  glance, many seem okay and to be moving along in life in rhythmic harmony. Like the waves of color swirling in the night sky, we dance
                                                  and sway through each day never letting on about what's really going on in the dark recesses of our minds. But when you examine things
                                                  more closely, you begin to see the brokenness and fear. In a way, I think this is what makes this painting all the more beautiful because
                                                  it isn't just about oil paints on a canvas, but an example of how all of us can be at one time or another. Am I stretching a bit here?
                                                  Sure, you can say that. Am I accurate in my interpretation? Who knows? But that's how The Starry Night speaks to me and that's why art
                                                  exists. It stirs our minds and imaginations. It speaks to us . . . and when it speaks to me, I really want to listen.<br></div>

            <div class="modal5" id="modal5"><a href="#" class="js-close-modal5"></a>The Beauty of the Starry Night<br><br>
                                                  Ever since I was little, art has allowed imagination run wild. As someone who actively enjoys making and viewing art,
                                                  I can relate to Vincent van Gogh's emotions while he was painting because my emotions drive my art as well. I remember
                                                  seeing The Starry Night for the first time, and I was transfixed by its swirls and stars and by the emotions I felt
                                                  within myself. I look to the swirls and the sky, and I feel like I am floating on the cool midnight current of the
                                                  small, articulate brushstrokes. I look at the stars and I feel their radiating light through the warmth of their
                                                  bright color. I see the black cypress tree, with its branches erupting upwards to the sky, and I tell myself that
                                                  dark times cannot destroy me. I see the ordinary town and I am reminded to never forget where I came from. Every time
                                                  I see the painting, I still feel the same emotions.<br><br>
                                                  During the Post-Impressionist era, Vincent van Gogh painted The Starry Night while in Asylum at Saint-Remy in 1889.
                                                  The painting is considered the third part of a series that is preceded by Starry Night over the Rhone and Cafe Terrace
                                                  at Night, both of which also include a starry night sky. What makes The Starry Night so appealing? Is it the way the
                                                  stars shine? Or the contrast between the bright sky and the cypress tree? For me, it is the undeniable magic that all
                                                  art can conveys: emotion told by the the artist to the viewer.<br><br>
                                                  While Vincent van Gogh was working on the painting, Vincent and Theo, his brother, exchanged many letters, in which
                                                  they discussed painting and art, but van Gogh never addressed his work in detail, and The Starry Night was no different.
                                                  In one letter he wrote, “This morning I saw the country from my window a long time before sunrise, with nothing but the
                                                  morning star, which looked very big.” He mentions in another letter that he began “a new study of a starry sky” and
                                                  “It is not a return to the romantic or to religious ideas… more than is apparent, by colour and a more spontaneous
                                                  drawing than delusive accuracy, one could express the purer nature of a countryside…” (Letter 595). Vincent van Gogh
                                                  did not want The Starry Night to be romantic or religious or accurate. The countryside captured van Gogh, and he wanted
                                                  to capture it back in oil perfection. This may have been the inspiration for The Starry Night, but he never goes in depth
                                                  with his thoughts.<br><br>
                                                  It is no secret that van Gogh was not fazed by the thought of death. He once told his brother Theo, “The difference
                                                  between happiness and unhappiness! Both are necessary and useful, as well as death and disappearance…it is so relative-
                                                  and life is the same” (Letter 607). His outlook of death is apparent in The Starry Night with the cypress tree, which is
                                                  traditionally aligned with graveyards and mourning. The cypress tree connecting the stars ties directly with what van Gogh
                                                  said, “Why, I ask myself, shouldn't the shining dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France?
                                                  Just as we take the train to get to Tarascon or Rouen, we take death to reach a star” (Museum of Modern Art). The cypress
                                                  tree is the death train to reach the starry map of the night sky. In this sense, we as viewers can connect with the artist's
                                                  emotions towards death. As we grow as people, life goes on and we begin to die. As we die, we reach for the stars, much like
                                                  the cypress tree.<br><br>
                                                  As van Gogh stated, “It is not the language of painters but the language of nature which one should listen to...The feeling
                                                  for the things themselves, for reality, is more important than the feeling for pictures” (Vincent van Gogh Gallery). This is
                                                  evident in The Starry Night in the way van Gogh feels the need to have more “spontaneous drawing” instead of “delusive accuracy”
                                                  of what the scene really looks like, which allows for true feelings to be seen in between the strokes of the paintbrush from the
                                                  moon, to the town, to the cypress tree. Not only does he take his own advice while he paints, but he also reminds other artists
                                                  that listening to themselves and feeling nature is more important than trying to create a masterpiece without any imperfections.
                                                  This impacts me because I am both an artist and a perfectionist, which is a difficult combination at times as I struggle to
                                                  capture what I see before me. I have figured out that, although my particular work doesn't look like what others see, it is
                                                  something that captivated me. Just because it isn't perfectly accurate, I know that my emotions are on the canvas. At the
                                                  end of the day is that what art is all about? Emotion?<br><br>
                                                  Some people may just see a blue swirled sky, a yellow moon with glowing orbs, and a black flame-like thing on the left side.
                                                  If that's all that people saw, then it wouldn't be the most famous painting in the world. With The Starry Night, Vincent van
                                                  Gogh must have done something right to appeal to the entire human population. There is no disputing that the painting is truly
                                                  a work of art, but there is more to it than just pretty colors. Past the stars, traveling through the currents of the paint,
                                                  reaching farther than the cypress, is the heart of art, which is emotion. It is one thing to feel something while you create
                                                  art, it is another to invoke emotions in the viewer as well. To do both, well... that is magical.<br></div>
