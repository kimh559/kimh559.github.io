        <h1>Reflections on Mary Cassatt & Mother's Day</h1>
        <p>
            Mary Stevenson Cassatt was an American painter and printmaker.<br> 
            She lived much of her adult life in France, where she became friends<br> 
            with Edgar Degas and later exhibited among the Impressionists as one of<br> 
            “les trois grandes dames” (the three great ladies). She was famous for<br> 
            creating images of the social and private lives of women, with particular<br> 
            emphasis on the intimate bonds between mothers and children.<br> 
            Little Girl in a Blue Armchair is one of her most important works.<br> 
            The painting was possibly shown at the Fourth Impressionist Exhibition 1879<br> 
            as Portrait de petite fille. At that time Cassatt was in conflict with the<br> 
            official French art establishment and had her submissions rejected by the<br> 
            official Salon. It was no deal for her when Edgar Degas invited her to<br> 
            join the Impressionists.

            The painting, dazzling with its predominant hue of deep turquoise,<br> 
            was purchased from the artist by Ambroise Vollard of Paris around 1903<br> 
            for his gallery, and was later acquired by Hector Brame of Paris.<br> 
            It was sold in 1963 to Mr. and Mrs. Paul Mellon. They lent it to the<br> 
            National Gallery of Art for exhibitions and eventually gifted it in 1983<br> 
            to NGA. For Griselda Pollock, a visual theorist, cultural analyst and <br>
            scholar of international, postcolonial feminist studies in the visual arts,<br> 
            it is one of the most radical images of childhood of the time. It may be true.<br> 
            Cassatt herself once wrote: “I love to paint children. They are so natural and truthful.”<br>
