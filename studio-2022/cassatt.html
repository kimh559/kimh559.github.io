        <h1><center>Reflections on Mary Cassatt & Mother's Day</center></h1>
        <p><center>
            Mary Stevenson Cassatt was an American painter and printmaker. She lived much of her adult life in France,<br> 
            where she became friends with Edgar Degas and later exhibited among the Impressionists as one of “les trois<br> 
            grandes dames” (the three great ladies). She was famous for creating images of the social and private lives<br> 
            of women, with particular emphasis on the intimate bonds between mothers and children. Little Girl in a Blue Armchair<br> 
            is one of her most important works. The painting was possibly shown at the Fourth Impressionist Exhibition 1879<br> 
            as Portrait de petite fille. At that time Cassatt was in conflict with the official French art establishment and<br> 
            had her submissions rejected by the official Salon. It was no deal for her when Edgar Degas invited her to<br> 
            join the Impressionists.

            The painting, dazzling with its predominant hue of deep turquoise, was purchased from the artist by Ambroise Vollard<br> 
            of Paris around 1903 for his gallery, and was later acquired by Hector Brame of Paris. It was sold in 1963 to <br>
            Mr. and Mrs. Paul Mellon. They lent it to the National Gallery of Art for exhibitions and eventually gifted it in 1983<br> 
            to NGA. For Griselda Pollock, a visual theorist, cultural analyst and scholar of international, postcolonial feminist<br> 
            studies in the visual arts, it is one of the most radical images of childhood of the time. It may be true. <br>
            Cassatt herself once wrote: “I love to paint children. They are so natural and truthful.”
