        <p><center>This webpage is part of project 2: Dinner for Two. It is a creative recipe that
                   focuses on pulling together typography, stylesheet, and what defines a "recipe".</center></p>

        <ul><center>
            <li>three cups of rhythym</li>
            <li>one teaspoon of reality</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of melancholy</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups of emotional intelligence</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of contentness</li>
            <li>2 dashes of dramatic endings</li>
        </center></ul>
       
        <h3><center>Instructions</center></h3>
       
        <ol><center>
            <li>honey cakes so soft to the touch
                glassy fruit laid out a-front
                teacups delicate and sweet smelling herbs
                along with my tea steam does the air around me stir</li>
            <li>white lace dances along the table cloth
                and whistling winds chatter with trees
                the oven's excitement brings about aromas of love
                as my window welcomes home the sun rays from above</li>
            <li>my guests range in sizes and smiles
                eager to share beautiful flowers of wild
                we sit and serve surrounded with petals
                and away our sadnesses fly, to our dreams in which we revel</li>
            <li>tart flavors fade into memories of haze
                we creatures love our afternooning through the day
                a celebration of food and flight
                and of course dancing to prove off our superiority of the jive</li>
            <li>once again the sunset graces our eyes
                her gentle dipping into the horizon which we so admire
                our sadnesses which had lingered for so long
                follow her home to come back another day</li>
            </center></ol>
