            <li>Open with a soft entrance of descriptive words<br>
                to stimulate the reader's sense. Introduce them<br>
                to your poem's world by trying to embody the different<br>
                elements of what makes it up.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Go into the small details. Paint a more specific image<br> 
                by dotting in various touches. Mention the parts that<br>
                catch your eye, whether extravagant or simple.</li>
                <br>
            <li>If there are any present, bring in the people, characters,<br>
                and subjects that exist within your poem's world; give them<br>
                personalities, purposes, and storylines. </li>
                <br>
            <li>This part can encompass any meanings you want.<br>
                It can cover a theme, tell another part of the story,<br>
                or even serve as a simple description.<br>
                </li>
                <br>
            <li>The ending can go many different ways, dramatically<br>
                or simple or bittersweet. Make sure to touch on your<br>
                theme again in some way and provide some sort of closure<br>
                for your reader to absorb, even if it is one word, sentence,<br>
                or phrase.</li>

                honey cakes so soft to the touch<br>
                glassy fruit laid out a-front<br>
                teacups delicate<br>
                and sweet smelling herbs<br>
                along with my tea steam<br>
                does the air around me stir<br>
    <br>
                white lace dances along the table cloth<br>
                and whistling winds chatter with trees<br>
                the oven’s excitement<br>
                brings about aromas of love<br>
                as my window welcomes home<br>
                the sun rays from above<br>
    <br>
                my guests range in sizes and smiles<br>
                eager to share beautiful flowers of wild<br>
                we sit and serve surrounded with petals<br>
                and away our sadnesses fly, <br>
                to our dreams in which we revel<br>
    <br>
                tart flavors fade into memories of haze<br>
                we creatures do love<br>
                our afternooning through the day<br>
                a celebration of food and flight<br>
                and of course dancing to prove off <br>
                our superiority of the jive<br>
    <br>
                once again the sunset graces our eyes<br>
                her gentle dipping into the horizon<br>
                which we so admire<br>
                our sadnesses which had lingered<br>
                for some mintues too long<br>
                follow her home to come back<br>
                some other dawn<br>
