        <h1>Dinner Party Recipe</h1>
        
        <p>How to throw a dinner party (through poetry and prose)</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>use as needed– improvisation is encouraged.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>three cups of rhythym</li>
            <li>one teaspoon of reality</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of melancholy</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups of emotional intelligence</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of contentness</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of dramatic endings</li>
        </ul>
       
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
       
        <ol>
            <li>Open with a soft entrance of descriptive words<br>
                to stimulate the reader's sense. Introduce them<br>
                to your poem's world by trying to embody the different<br>
                elements of what makes it up.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Go into the small details. Paint a more specific<br>
                image by dotting in various touches. Mention the <br>
                parts that catch your eye, whether extravagant or simple.</li>
                <br>
            <li>If there are any present, bring in the people/characters/subjects<br>
                that exist within your poem's world; give them personalities, purposes,<br>
                and storylines. </li>
                <br>
            <li>This part can encompass any meanings you want. It can cover a theme, <br>
                tell another part of the story, or even serve as a simple description.<br>
                </li>
                <br>
            <li>The ending can go many different ways, dramatically or simple or bittersweet.<br>
                Make sure to touch on your theme again in some way and provide some sort of closure<br>
                for your reader to absorb, even if it is one word, sentence, or phrase.</li>
                <br>
            </ol>
        
        <h3>The Final Product</h3>

        <p>
            honey cakes so soft to the touch<br>
            glassy fruit laid out a-front<br>
            teacups delicate and sweet smelling herbs<br>
            along with my tea steam does the air around me stir<br>

            white lace dances along the table cloth<br>
            and whistling winds chatter with trees<br>
            the oven’s excitement brings about aromas of love<br>
            as my window welcomes home the sun rays from above<br>

            my guests range in sizes and smiles<br>
            eager to share beautiful flowers of wild<br>
            we sit and serve surrounded with petals<br>
            and away our sadnesses fly, to our dreams in which we revel<br>

            tart flavors fade into memories of haze<br>
            we creatures love our afternooning through the day<br>
            a celebration of food and flight<br>
            and of course dancing to prove off our superiority of the jive<br>

            once again the sunset graces our eyes<br>
            her gentle dipping into the horizon which we so admire<br>
            our sadnesses which had lingered for so long<br>
            follow her home to come back another dawn<br>
