        <h1><center>Collective Self</center></h1>

        <center><div class="textbox"><h2 class="leftheadings">Conceptual Origins</h2>
        <center><p id="paragraph1">I began this project by brainstorming and reflecting<br>
           on what digital worlds I have belonged to throughout<br>
           my life. I found that much of the worlds I enjoyed<br>
           spending time in throughout my childhood had to do<br>
           with personalizing avatars, competing with friends,<br>
           and playing any kind of internet game<br>
           <br>
           One kind of the place I would always spend hours on when<br>
           I was younger were those websites that had an array of<br>
           games like chess, sudoko, crosswords, and word searches.<br>
           Using that as my base, I began to brainstorm a way to<br>
           novelize those games and include an avatar.</p></center>

        <center><h2 class="leftheadings">Process</h2></center>
        <center><ol>
            <li>I began the process by trying to think of a simple<br>
                way to connect two interactors through a work search<br>
                game. A simple competition seemed too basic, so after<br>
                doing some research, I found that the Apple iMessage<br>
                application used Game Pigeon as a way to allow two<br>
                people to play a continuoues game.</li><br>
            <li>Instead of having my avatar be an anonymous organizer<br>
                like the Game Pigeon, I thought it would be better to<br>
                have it be a downloaded extension of iMessage that the<br>
                user could directly "chat" with.</li><br>
            <li>Going back to the actual concept, I thought it could be<br>
                fun to allow the users to create their own wordseaches<br>
                and use them as ways to send secret or encrypted messages.</li>
            <li>My first prototype of the complete concept only included<br>
                one side of the conversation and was just a simple message<br>
                between two co-workers.</li><br>
            <li>After a class critique, I began to develop the idea in terms<br>
                of what the possibilites could be and if I could use the idea<br>
                within a more fun environment.</li>
            </ol></center>

        <center><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusion</h2></center>
        <center><p class="leftheadings">Overall, I really enjoyed how this project allowed us flexibility<br>
                   in creating a digital platform. I liked how successful my project<br>
                   was in being personalized to my past digital worlds and it is a<br>
                   platform that I would use if it was available. The most difficult<br>
                   part of this project was just coordinating and editing the texting<br>
                   exchange into a video. I don't think I am completely finished with<br>
                   this project as I would like to expand on the different situations<br>
                   the avatar can be used in and delve a little deeper in designing the<br>
                   execution of everything.</p></center>
