        <h2 class="leftheadings">Conceptual Origins</h2>
        <p id="paragraph1">I began this project by brainstorming and reflecting<br>
           on what digital worlds I have belonged to throughout<br>
           my life. I found that much of the worlds I enjoyed<br>
           spending time in throughout my childhood had to do<br>
           with personalizing avatars, competing with friends,<br>
           and playing any kind of internet game<br>
           <br>
           One kind of the place I would always spend hours on when<br>
           I was younger were those websites that had an array of<br>
           games like chess, sudoko, crosswords, and word searches.<br>
           Using that as my base, I began to brainstorm a way to<br>
           novelize those games and include an avatar.</p>
